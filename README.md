# C969-WGU-Software-II-Appointment
Customer Appointment application written in C# and MySQL for a school project. It requires a user name "test" and password "test" to login. It displays the login page in two differnent languages, based on the user's location. It has a login recorder which is viewable with a report. Customers and appointments can be created and edited. It converts entered times to UTC and displays them back in local time of the viewer. Various reports can be run and filtered. Two graphical calendar views are available, Month and Week. Various exception handling is coded. A seperate project "MySQL" is included to populate the projct with data. It should not be part of the main program but used as a seperate program, just to populate the database. This is the final commit. I passed the course.
